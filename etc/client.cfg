## Optional settings now follow
##


##
## Every time a client connects to the server it sends a name, which the server
## may choose to use to assign a static IP address.
##
## If you have multiple hosts with identical names you can send an explicit
## alternative here.  (For example if you have "www.example.com" and
## "www.example.net" both hosts will be named "www".)
#
# name = frodo
#


##
## When the client connects to the VPN server it will launch a series
## of commands to configure IP, route, and gateway.
##
## If you wish you may configure a command to execute after that.  This
## "up" command will receive details of the link via environmental
## variables:
##
##  $DEVICE    -  e.g. tun0.
##  $CLIENT_IP -  e.g 10.0.0.2.
##  $SERVER_IP -  e.g. 10.0.0.1.
##  $SUBNET    -  e.g. 10.0.0.0/24.
##  $MTU       -  e.g. 1280.
##
#
# up = /etc/simple-vpn/blah.sh
